    "Due to the increase in transmit power, the energy consumes will be higher per unit time. Thus the talk time will decrease. Originally, it has 18000 joules in the battery at 1 Watt. Therefore, the talk time will be 18000 / 1 / 3600 = 5 hours of talk time. After the transmit power is increased to 1.35 Watt, the talk time will be 18000 / 1.35 / 3600 = 3.7 hours of total talk time. Thus the talk time decreased by 1.3 hours for a 0.35 Watt of transmitting power increased.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Comment on any improvement in the narrow-band speech quality that is obtained at the expense of the 3-fold increase in the bit-rate.\n",
    "Firstly, the quality of the sound is much better for values of bit-error probability from 10^-5 to 10^-3.4. The PESQ score for sound produced with probability in the range (from 10^-5 to 10^-3.4) is 4.5. For non FEC encoded sound, it's varied from 4 to 3 PESQ score for the given range. The average PESQ score overall is much higher for the 3-fold increase method 4.0 to 2.4 for non FEC encoded. Furthermore, the sound produced using 3-fold increase in bit rate has less noise and buzzing sound than non FEC encoded sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the effect of the 3-fold increase in bit-rate on the transmit power and on the energy required to transmit the speech segment?\n",
    "The 3-fold increase will cause the transmit power to increase, as more power is required to transfer three copies of a message instead of one. Therefore, the energy required to transmit each speech segment is also increased, this is because there will be 3 segments per speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. If we reduce the energy per bit by a factor of 3, the transmit power becomes what it was before? Consider the example in Section 2.5 where E b /N 0 was 8.93 dB. It would now become 8.93 – 10xlog 10 (3) = 8.93 - 4.8 dB= 4.3 dB. From the msk waterfall graph above, the beP now becomes about 0.01. How well does the (3,1) rep coder work at beP=0.01?\n",
    "For beP = 0.01, the (3,1) rep coder has a PESQ score of 2.0 and the non (3,1) rep coder has a PESQ score of 1.45.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What other method could be used to reduce the energy required to transmit the speech sentence without reducing the energy per bit? Think about previous Tasks.\n",
    "By reducing the sampling frequency and bit-rate using uniform quantisation. This means for a constant energy per bit, if we reduce the bit-rate there will be less energy required overall (total) for the message transmission, as it's used a lower bit-rate."

    "### 1. If the CRC8 check succeeds, can we deduce that there are no bit-errors?\n",
    "No, we can't guarantee that the transmitted message has no bit-errors. Even though, it's very likely that there are no bit-errors. This is because in my experiment, sometimes the check succeeded, but the output string is completely different to the original string. Thus I added a boolean clause \"and test_string == string_error\" to make sure that the output string is the same as the original string also.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. If the CRC8 check fails, can we deduce that there are some bit-errors?\n",
    "Yes, if the check failed it's guarantee (100%) that there is some bit-errors.\n",

    "### 3. At what beP did the ARQ process fail completely?\n",
    "The ARQ process started to fail completely for beP = 0.00398107170553\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Do you find this an efficient method? Can you think of a way of improving it by combining failed retransmissions?\n",
    "The method is efficient for beP value smaller than 0.00398107170553. After that, the method becomes very inefficient as there are many useless re-transmission. A way of improving this method is to store failed transmissions into a buffer every time a transmission fails, then the program will attempt to create the message from these failed transmissions. If the attempt failed, the message is re-transmitted again and the same process will get executed. "
